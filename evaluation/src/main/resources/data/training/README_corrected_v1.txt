There was a mistake in the original v1 of the training collection for
2014. f4.xml was "sing we and chant it" when it should have been Bach invention
no. 10. f5.xml remains as "sing we and chant it".

The f4.xml in this zip file is now the invention no 10 as intended.

However, there is a mistake in f4.xml which cannot be corrected: Bar 15 is
18 quavers long when it should be two bars of nine quavers each. Attempts to
correct this have failed - it always reverts to this form once the file is
reloaded. What is more, the bar after this double-length one is always number
16 and never changes.

Bar numbers for answers to questions against f4.xml are relative to the bar
numbers as shown by the score in musescore.
